<h1>Mighty Math Markdown</h1>

<p>Mighty Math Markdown is:</p>
<ul>
<li>A syntax that lets you type math the way you already know how.</li>
<li>A library that renders that syntax into beautiful HTML math (MathML) on your webpage.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mighty Math Markdown is based on the way people already write math using plain ASCII text in emails and on web forums.</p>

<p>Mighty Math Markdown is named after John Gruber’s original Markdown. It’s called "Mighty" to distinguish it from any other products that might be called Math Markdown, and because I like alliteration.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<pre>x = -b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4.a.c) / 2a</pre>

<p>gives</p>

%% x = -b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4.a.c) / 2a %%
